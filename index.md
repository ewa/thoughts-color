# You've seen this picture, and it's wrong.

If your experience is has been like mine, you've seen some variation of this image[^1] attempting to present color in terms of the spectrum of visible light wavelengths:


![Figure 1: Color as a spectrum](Spectrum4websiteEval.png "Image of colors ostensibly ranging from violet to red")

There are two key problems with this:  First, almost all real objects emit or reflect more than one wavelength of light.
